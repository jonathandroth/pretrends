Title: Power Calculations and Visualization for Pre-trends
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jonathan Roth
Maintainer: Jonathan Roth <jonathan.roth@microsoft.com>
Description: This package provides tools for evaluating the power of pre-trends tests, as well as the potential distortions from pre-testing. Given a hypothesized difference in trends, the user can calculate the power of the pre-trends test to detect the trend, and the expected bias conditional on passing the pre-test. The user can also calculate the linear violations of parallel trends against which the pre-test has a particular power level. The package also provides tools for visualizing violations of parallel trends on an event-plot.
