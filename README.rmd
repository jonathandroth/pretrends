# pretrends

<!-- badges: start -->
  <!-- badges: end -->

  The pretrends package provides tools for power calculations for pre-trends tests, and visualization of possible violations of parallel trends. Calculations are based on [Roth (Forthcoming)](https://jonathandroth.github.io/assets/files/roth_pretrends_testing.pdf). (Please cite the paper if you enjoy the package!) 
  
If you're not an R user, you may also be interested in the associated [Shiny app](https://github.com/jonathandroth/PretrendsPower).

## Installation

You can install the released version of pretrends from Github using the devtools package:

```{r, eval = F}
# install.packages("devtools") #install devtools if not installed
devtools::install_github("jonathandroth/pretrends")
```


## Application to He and Wang (2017)

We illustrate how to use the package with an application to [He and Wang (2017)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20160079). The analysis will be based on the event-study in Figure 2C, which looks like this:

### Load the package and data

  We first load the pretrends package.

``` {r}
library(pretrends)
```

Next we load the estimation results used for the event-plot, namely the coefficients (*beta*), the variance-covariance matrix (*sigma*), and the corresponding event-times (*t*). In this case, these coefficients come from a two-way fixed effects regression, but the pretrends package can accommodate an event-study from any asymptotically normal estimator, including [Callaway and Sant'Anna (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620303948?dgcid=author) and [Sun and Abraham (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030440762030378X).


``` {r}
#Load the coefficients, covariance matrix, and time periods
beta <- pretrends::HeAndWangResults$beta
sigma <- pretrends::HeAndWangResults$sigma
tVec <- pretrends::HeAndWangResults$tVec
referencePeriod <- -1 #This is the omitted period in the regression
data.frame(t = tVec, beta = beta)
```

### Using the package

The pretrends package has two main functions. The first is *slope_for_power()*, which calculates the slope of a linear violation of parallel trends that a pre-trends test would detect a specified fraction of the time. (By detect, we mean that there is any significant pre-treatment coefficient.)

```{r}
#Compute slope that gives us 50% power
slope50 <-
slope_for_power(sigma = sigma,
                targetPower = 0.5,
                tVec = tVec,
                referencePeriod = referencePeriod)
slope50
```

The package's second (and main) function is *pretrends()*, which enables power analyses and visualization given the results of an event-study and a user-hypothesized difference in trends. We illustrate this using the linear trend against which pre-tests have 50 percent power, computed above.

```{r}
pretrendsResults <- 
  pretrends(betahat = beta, 
            sigma = sigma, 
            tVec = tVec, 
            referencePeriod = referencePeriod,
            deltatrue = slope50 * (tVec - referencePeriod))

```

The pretrends function returns a list of objects, which we examine in turn. First, we can visualize the event-plot and the hypothesized trend.

```{r}
pretrendsResults$event_plot
```

Next, *df_power* displays several useful statistics about the power of the pre-test against the hypothesized trend:

- **Power** The probability that we would find a significant pre-trend under the hypothesized pre-trend. (This is 0.50, up to numerical precision error, by construction in our example).

- **Bayes Factor** The ratio of the probability of ''passing'' the pre-test under the hypothesized trend relative to under parallel trends.

- **Likelihood Ratio** The ratio of the likelihood of the observed coefficients under the hypothesized trend relative to under parallel trends.
```{r}
pretrendsResults$df_power
```

Next, *df_eventplot* contains the data used to make the event-plot. It also includes a column *meanAfterPretesting*, which shows the expected value of the coefficients conditional on passing the pre-test under the hypothesized trend.

```{r}
pretrendsResults$df_eventplot
```

Finally, the plot event_plot_pretest adds the *meanAfterPretesting* to the original event-plot.

```{r}
pretrendsResults$event_plot_pretest
```


Although our example has focused on a linear violation of parallel trends, the package allows the user to input an arbitrary non-linear hypothesized trend. For instance, here is the event-plot and power analysis from a quadratic trend.

```{r}
  quadraticPretrend <-
  pretrends(betahat = beta, 
            sigma = sigma, 
            tVec = tVec, 
            referencePeriod = referencePeriod,
            deltatrue = 0.024 * (tVec - referencePeriod)^2)

quadraticPretrend$event_plot_pretest
```
```{r}
quadraticPretrend$df_power
```
